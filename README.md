 Closure Plots for Basic Arithmetics

The main use of this software (Closure Plots for Basic Arithmetics which will be referred to as "CPBA" throughout this report.) is to illustrate the behaviour of basic arithmetic operations in Floating-Point arithmetic with different bit-width of web based software, so the user can access it virtually from anywhere.\\

This software is based on the principle of float in the floating point which is derived from the fact that there is no fixed number of digits before and after the decimal point. That is, the decimal point can float. Therefore, the objective of the CPBA application is to create a visualization tool for illustrating the behaviour of basic arithmetic operations (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division) to integer with a fixed-size of bit string, which refer to the same size of bit-width (Half $2^{16}$, Single $2^{32}$, Double $2^{64}$, Quadruple $2^{128}$ ). Also, to create the infrastructure that will allow for future development to make it possible to extend the project of illustrating the behaviour of decimal numbers, rational numbers, and all the irrational numbers in Floating-Point eg. IEEE Floating-Point Standard or something else with this approach.\\
